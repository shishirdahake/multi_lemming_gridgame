# ðŸ§  Lemming Game

A lightweight multi-agent coordination environment in a 2D maze. Agents ("lemmings") must navigate through obstacles and reach the goal cell **together** â€” with rules for movement, collisions, and rewards.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- 10Ã—10 handcrafted mazes
- Multi-agent support (configurable number of lemmings)
- Movement constrained by walls, bounds, and collision rules
- Truncation and termination support
- ASCII-based terminal rendering
- Gym-like API (`reset()`, `step()`, `render()`)
- Pluggable maze bank (`MAZE_BANK`)
- Sample random action simulator (`sample_actions()`)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Maze Bank
| Key          | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `simple`     | Wide open layout with two main paths    |
| `bottleneck` | Narrow central corridor, collision risk |
| `open_trap`  | Open-looking layout with internal traps |

Use it like this:
```bash
from lemming_game import Game, MAZE_BANK
game = Game(maze=MAZE_BANK["bottleneck"])
```
